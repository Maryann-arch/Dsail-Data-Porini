## Introduction

The `FINAL CAMERATRAP.ipynb` notebook serves as a guide for analyzing camera trap data. It covers various essential steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. By leveraging this notebook, you can gain insights into the behavior and population dynamics of wildlife captured through camera traps.

## Installation

To use the notebook locally, ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:

          - Pandas
          - NumPy
          - Matplotlib
          - Scikit-learn
          - Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
$ pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

Alternatively, you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies within it.

## Usage

To utilize the `FINAL CAMERATRAP.ipynb` notebook effectively, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `FINAL CAMERATRAP.ipynb` file directly.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
3. Open the `FINAL CAMERATRAP.ipynb` notebook within Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions and execute the code cells sequentially to perform the camera trap data analysis.
5. Customize the notebook as needed, modifying the code or adding new sections to cater to your specific requirements and datasets.

## Contributing

The project ensure we have indepenent observation from our captures. The main aim is to remove rebundancy of different captures whileas they have the same annotation with a certain time duration(10 minutes)
